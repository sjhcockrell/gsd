# GSD, aka "Get sh\_t done script"

### What it does

Are you a web developer and use multiple browsers? Too much of a pain to coordinate productivity plugins between FF, Safari, and Chrome?

Use this handy script to route time-suck websites to local host while you're working, and then turn them back on later.

### Installing

Works for OS X 10.4+

Download, then navigate to the downloaded folder using a terminal.

Edit the `blocked_sites` file to add/remove time-suck websites.

Run `sudo install_gsd`

Super. Now run `sudo gsd on` to block those websites, and `sudo gsd off` to unblock them after you're done working.

Enjoy productivity.

### H/T

I'm still learning bash scripting, so this little exercise is thanks to the work of :
